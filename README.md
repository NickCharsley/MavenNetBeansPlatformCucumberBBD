# MavenNetBeansPlatformCucumberBBD

This is my attempt at getting a quick template to allow me to create NetBeans Platform Apps that can be designed using BBD via Cucumber-JVM.

It was created using the NetBeans Platform Maven Template.

So the first Surprise was that later versions of Cucumber killed Jelly tools.

To start with we have,

cucumber-java version 1.0.0
cucumber-junit version 1.0.0

this may get updated later to see at which point they break.
